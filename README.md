# 99 Problems but a test ain't one

### What's it good for?

* Learning a new Lisp
* Playing with one you know already
* Trying different ways of testing

### How do I participate?

1. Start a project in a directory named with your username and the Lisp of your
choice. Example: `niftyn8+clojure`

2. Work through [99 Lisp Problems](http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2006s2/funcional/L-99_Ninety-Nine_Lisp_Problems.html)
with the Lisp of your choice. Write tests that show that your solution works.

3. Add a `README.md` file to your directory discussing your choices, how to run the tests, and any
other information you'd like to share with the group.

If you would like an example project to look at look at the `niftyn8+clojure` directory.

### For bonus points:

Even better, submit your solutions as pull requests and get someone to code review them.
